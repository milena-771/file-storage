# File Storage API 🗃️

## General description

This project is a file storage API developed as part of a school project. 
The API allows both **anonymous and authenticated users** to store files, with different privileges assigned to each. 
It is integrated into a **micro-services architecture** and includes its own database.
The application interacts with an other mail API to send access keys for authenticated users.
